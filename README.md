# CO-Project

We have made a custom built assembler and simulator on the basis of the ISA sheet provided which is capable of handling all kinds of functions which can made from the given ISA. The outputs have been verified as per the given sheet. The Assembler reads the input Txt file from a text file " Instructions.txt". Then it iterates over the given input to find all the possible errors and print them accordingly. Finally, if the given input is correct, it gives us the binary encoding of the same.
